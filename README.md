[![Jenkins](https://apm-ci.elastic.co/buildStatus/icon?job=apm-agent-ruby/ecs-logging-ruby-mbp/master)](https://apm-ci.elastic.co/job/apm-agent-ruby/job/ecs-logging-ruby-mbp/job/master/) [![Gem](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/ecs-logging.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/ecs-logging)

This set of libraries allows you to transform your application logs to structured logs that comply with the [Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-reference.html).
In combination with [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat), send your logs directly to Elasticsearch and leverage [Kibana's Logs app](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/observability/current/monitor-logs.html) to inspect all of your logs in a single place.
See [ecs-logging](https://github.com/elastic/ecs-logging) for other ECS logging libraries and more resources about ECS & logging.
